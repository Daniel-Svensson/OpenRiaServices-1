## New Features

* Link Open RIA Services right click menu renamed to Manage Open RIA Services Project Link.
* Signed versions of all templates have been added. Signed templates use OpenRiaServices.Signed.* NuGet packages.

## Bug Fixes

* The Link Open RIA Services right click menu was only working for projects that were inside solution folders. This should be fixed now.
* There was a change made inside Visual Studio that is causing the Domain Service Wizard to fail when creating new DomainServices. More information can be found on the following page:
